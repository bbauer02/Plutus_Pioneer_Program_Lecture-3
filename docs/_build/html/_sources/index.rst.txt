Plutus Pioneer Program Cohort 3 - Notes en Français
=====================================================

These are my notes from the `series of videos by Lars Brünjes <https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program>`_ for the Plutus Pioneers Program. I have also documented my journey through the Alonzo White testnet 
with instructions on how to run a node and how to compile and deploy Plutus code.

.. note:: If you find these notes useful and would like give support, please consider delegating some ADA to `CHESS Pool <https://chess.ihpapp.com>`__.

The source code for the lectures can be found `here <https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program/tree/main/code>`_.

To stay up-to-date with changes to these notes, you can follow me on Twitter @PoolChess. They are currently being updated for the second iteration of the program.
